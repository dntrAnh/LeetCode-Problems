# LeetCode-Problems

ðŸ¥¸ Welcome to my LeetCode Problems repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of solving coding challenges on LeetCode, where I practice and enhance my problem-solving skills in a variety of programming languages including **Java**, **Python**, and **SQL**. 

## About This Repository

I have a passion for tackling algorithmic challenges and improving my coding skills, and LeetCode provides an excellent platform for that. Each day, I solve different problems ranging from easy to hard, and I update this repository with my solutions to track my progress and reflect on the techniques I've learned along the way.

### What You Will Find Here

- **Java Solutions**: Many of the problems are solved using Java, showcasing my understanding of object-oriented programming and various data structures.
- **Python Solutions**: I also enjoy using Python for its simplicity and versatility, especially for problems involving quick data manipulation and prototyping.
- **SQL Queries**: For database-related challenges, I practice writing SQL queries, demonstrating my skills in data retrieval and management.

## LeetCode Profile

You can view my progress and solve problems along with me on my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/u/ameliado/). This profile contains a comprehensive record of the problems Iâ€™ve tackled, my current ranking, and various badges earned through consistent practice.

## Goals

Through this repository, I aim to:

- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.
- Sharpen my coding skills in multiple programming languages.
- Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving that I can apply in technical interviews and real-world scenarios.

I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for myself and others who are also looking to improve their coding skills. Feel free to explore the solutions and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
